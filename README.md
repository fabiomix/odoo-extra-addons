# Odoo Extra Addons
This repository contains a collection of Odoo modules with various purposes.

## Default branch
Please note that the default branch is the lowest supported version.
New modules should start from this version and be migrated to later versions.
So, unlike Odoo's standard approach, commits here are not backported
but forward-ported.

Older versions than the default branch may receive bugfixes
but should be considered as no longer supported.

This workflow is experimental and subject to change (but it probably won't,
like all "temporary" things in IT, and also because fixing the Git history
would be a mess...).
