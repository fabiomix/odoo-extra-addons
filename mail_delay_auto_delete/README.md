# Mail Delay Auto Delete
Set a time retention policy for sent email.

## Features
Odoo has an option to delete emails after sending them to save space.

This module is designed to postpone the deletion of emails, by default to 48
hours later. This should help you control outgoing emails while maintaining the
original function of saving space.

## Configuration
In system parameters you can add `mail.auto_delete.delay` and set a custom
retention policy in hours.
